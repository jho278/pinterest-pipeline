# Emulation of the Pinterest data pipeline
For my final project with AICore, I will emulate the data pipeline for the Pinterest posts using a combination of AWS, Databricks and Python in VS Code. I aim to develop a workflow covering: 
- Data ingestion of the Pinterest data into AWS via Apache Kafka in an EC2 instance. 
- Data storage of the Pinterest data in a S3 object. 
- Mounting the S3 storage in Databricks for transformation and analysis. 

I will have demonstrated the application of my knowledge in AWS by processing data in real-time and creating a workflow to analyse the data to inform my stakeholders and provide analysis to support decision-making.
